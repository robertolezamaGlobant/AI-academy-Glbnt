# AI Academy Globant 101

This repository will act as the central codebase for the exercises that will be use during the **AI Academy**.

The idea is to provided students the basic starting points to start on the AI Revolution and get familiar with the different aspects that under the AI univers like: Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Generative AI, etc... You can find more information about this initiative on the **AI HUB Monterrey** [site](https://sites.google.com/globant.com/ai-hub-monterrey/proyectos/ai-academy).

We will cover those topics on a high level without going to deep on those areas. The idea of the phase of the Academy is to establish the base line. We wil explore each subject in deep and detail in subsequent phases (TBD).
